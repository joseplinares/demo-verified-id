    <h1>Domain exmaple for MS Entra demo</h1>
    <p>The domain is what binds your DID to something tangible that the user might know about your business. Microsoft
        Authenticator and other digital wallets use this information to validate that your DID is linked to your domain.
        If the wallet can verify the DID, it displays a verified symbol. If the wallet can't verify the DID, it informs
        the user that the credential was issued by an organization it couldn't validate.</p>
